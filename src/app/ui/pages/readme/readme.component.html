        <p> So far I have run the application successfully on Windows with <strong>Chrome</strong>,
            <strong>Firefox</strong>,
            <strong>Opera</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong> browsers.I have also used the application successfully on a
            mobile phone running Android with Chrome.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application will function on <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> on Windows but has display issues where
            the text and images overlap on some screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have not tried with <strong>Safari</strong> or with any browser runnning on an Apple device. Please let me
            know if you have an Apple device and it works for you.

            I have not tried the application in any browser under Linux yet.
