            The application will function on <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> on Windows but has display issues where
            the text and images overlap on some screen sizes.

In the solver pressing ESC should cancel any highlighting

When failing to download a puzzle distinguish between "not found" and general errors.  For example: when trying
to open future puzzles in the Independent they may not be there yet.  This is not an error, so show a more appropriate 
error message.

Sometimes the app does not correctly distinguish between a password mismatch and a login failure due to a network problem or other general error.

In the Solver screen make the clue editor moveable so that it does not obscure the grid.

Add a "remember me" cookie

Add a configurable footer section to the blog entry (store to server?)

Add a help tip somewhere to say that puzzles are automatically saved.  Also mention that saved puzzles are lost
if you delete your browser history.

Sort out return, tab, esc etc in editor so that it is easy to add solution and comments without using the mouse

Add a carte blanch tool

Add the google calendar

Add "insert image from URL" to clue and preamble editors

Investigate using REST API instead of XML-RPC - investigate adding OpenAuth to fifteensquared

Create favicon for the app - get Jessica to do this?

Log usage statistics somewhere

Add a feedback facility somewhere. This could be permanent or just for the remainder of the development.
Perhaps just a link to an email address?  Perhaps a page in the app where users can see the feedback
from other users too.

Send client-side errors to drurys.org for analysis (opt-in)
