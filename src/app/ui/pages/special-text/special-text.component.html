<h5>Notes on formatting the text:</h5>
<p>The across clues should be prefaced with a line containing the text "ACROSS", the down clues with "DOWN".</p>

The basic rules for entering clues are:
<ul>
    <li>There should be one clue per line</li>
    <li>Clues should start with the clue number</li>
    <li>Clues should end with the letter count</li>
</ul>

<pre class="bg-light">
ACROSS
1 Goodnight ladies (5)
2 Ladies goodnight (2, 4)
DOWN
3 This is a clue (2-2)
</pre>

Some optional features for more complex puzzles are:
<ul>
    <li>Optionally, additional clue numbers may be added for linked clues, separated by commas</li>
    <li>Optionally, numbers for linked clues may be supplimented with "across" or "down" to remove ambiguity</li>
    <li>Redirections should be of the form "See n" where n is the clue number</li>
    <li>Optionally, redirections can be supplimented with "across" or down" to remove ambiguity</li>
</ul>

<pre class="bg-light">

<p>
    You can cut-and-paste text into here copied from another document, a PDF file for example.
    Any extaneous text before the first ACROSS marker and after the last down-clue will be ignored, but best to remove it
    before pressing the "continue" button just in case.
