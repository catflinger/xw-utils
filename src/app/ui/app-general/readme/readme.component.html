The blogger page should not display "answer does not fit space available message" because the answer is a mismatch for the grid.
Warning relating to the grid should only be displayed in the solver page.

In the solver pressing ESC should cancel any highlighting

For PDF based puzzles (Azed and Financial Times) the grid will not load correctly if the puzzle is shown rotated in the original PDF document
downloaded from the newspaper website. For example: the puzzle is laid out in landscape format but has been rotated 90 degrees in the PDF so 
that it displays and prints in portrait format.

The solver does not always highlight the right grid entry for redirects (eg "26 See 15" should highlight grid entry 15 not 26)

TABBED EDITOR (current work in progress):

Add tips to each tab on the editor explaining what the component is for

Make the GridLinker tab manually configurable

Make the tabbed editor work when a mis-matched grid is present

GENERAL

No need to check passwords when opening a PDF from the local PC

In the Solver screen make the clue editor moveable so that it does not obscure the grid.

Add a help tip somewhere to say that puzzles are automatically saved.  Also mention that saved puzzles are lost
if you delete your browser history.

Add a backup feature so users can save/restore from a backup (if they want to delete their history)

Add some way to get a private copy of a blog, in the case where the app cannot post to 225 for some reason

Sort out return, tab, esc etc in editor so that it is easy to add solution and comments without using the mouse

Add a carte blanch tool

Add "insert image from URL" to clue and preamble editors

Investigate using REST API instead of XML-RPC - investigate adding OpenAuth to fifteensquared

Create favicon for the app - get Jessica to do this?

Log usage statistics somewhere

Add a feedback facility somewhere. This could be permanent or just for the remainder of the development.
Perhaps just a link to an email address?  Perhaps a page in the app where users can see the feedback
from other users too.
