Adding images to blogs does not work properly

The About screen is still work in progress

The backup screen only shows backups from the server it was loaded form.  Show backups from both crosswords.drurys.org and drury2.org

The blogger page should not display "answer does not fit space available message" because the answer is a mismatch for the grid.
Warning relating to the grid should only be displayed in the solver page.

In the solver pressing ESC should cancel any highlighting

For PDF based puzzles (Azed and Financial Times) the grid will not load correctly if the puzzle is shown rotated in the original PDF document
downloaded from the newspaper website. For example: the puzzle is laid out in landscape format but has been rotated 90 degrees in the PDF so 
that it displays and prints in portrait format.

The solver does not always highlight the right grid entry for redirects (eg "26 See 15" should highlight grid entry 15 not 26)
