    ## Crossword Utilities v2 Beta
    This is the updated Crossword Utilites site currently in Beta test.

    Everything should be working but if you do come across any problems please email me at paul@drurys.org.
    The previous version of this app it will still be available at http://crosswords.drurys.org/angular 
    for the duration of this beta test. 

    ### Backwards Compatibility
    You might find that some puzzles created with an earlier version of the utilities will no longer load.
    These will have to be deleted.

    ### Changes in this version

    You can now create puzzles in additional ways.  Find these under `More...` on the `Puzzles` menu:
    * Load a puzzle from a PDF file on your PC
    * Create a new puzzle by entering clues as text
    * Create a new grid and add it to a puzzle

    You can correct errors in clues loaded form the Internet. These are found under new tabs in the 
    editor used for solving and blogging puzzles:
    * Correct misprints in clues
    * Correct a mis-numbered clue
    * Remove a clue

    There is a new `puzzle options...` link in the solver and blogger.  This allows you to:
    * Add a missing clue to the puzzle
    * Corrrect mistakes in the grid (missing bars and black sqares)
    * Change the puuzle title, setter and publication date
    * add extra columns in your blog (eg. for puzzles that require answers to be modified)

    You can now create backups
    * backup a puzzle (to the Internet)
    * restore a puzzle
    * move puzzles between computers
    * backup your settings
    * copy settings between computers
    
    There are some new settings (see `Settings` menu):

    * choose between fixed width or variable width for the application

    Improvements to existing functionality:
    * Downloader better at recognising awkward word-wrapping in clues
    * Downloader able to spot and correct some missing letter counts in clues
    * Solver pop-up is now larger and highlighting definitions is easier and more reliable
